So far, our implementation has been to change how the view matrix is calculated based, done by Nirav. While before, all the fields 
were filled in with 1, now, it is based off of the camera and the eye positions. This way, we can call get_view_matrix and have
the camera move or rotate or whatever we need it to for the mouse and keyboard input implementation, instead of having it default
to all 1's. We also have been looking through the starter code in order to better understand how everything fits together, as it
is not the same as the previous assignment. We have a plan for completing the assignment on time in that we now have a much better
understanding of the project and have a set schedule for when to meet up to work on it.
